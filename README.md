# BirdPi
This project uses a raspberry pi (any kind) to detect motion and subsequently record videos.  Using python's inbuilt socket library, the RPi connects to a server being any computer to transfer files.  PyQt is then used for a user interface to watch, screenshot and also livestream from RPi.  This code can be used for any scenario that requires little human interferance; however, this was initially used to record birds at a bird feeder.
